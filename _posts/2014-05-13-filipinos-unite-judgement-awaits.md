## Card Spotlight: Lantern, the Spirit of Grave Keeper  

Lantern is a Darkness Resonator on the first english set. It has a cost of just [D] (no generic), and a whopping 500 attack and defense. However, when this card is put into a graveyard, it is permanently destroyed.  

### Tactics  

With a cost of one will, a 500 attack and defense resonator is a beast on turn one. If your deck is Darkness heavy already, then including a set of Lantern is a no brainer- yes, it has a drawback of being removed from the game when destroyed, but if it can swing on turn two and deal damage, then this card has already paid for itself. If your opponent burns a removal to kill it, then you have just set the tempo of the game, since most spells that can kill Lantern costs more than what you paid to summon him. Even on late game, dealing 500 damage on either a resonator or your opponent is still a significant amount of damage, especially if it only costs 1 will.  

### Checks and Counters  

A cheap wall on turn one will delay Lantern, until a beefier turn two resonator can take him. It may be tempting to kill it with a spell, but only do so if you have no other choice. If you can wall Lantern off until you the second or third turn, then you'd have enough will to block AND kill it, saving your removal for other threats.
