        <p>So, you want to learn how to play Force of Will? Well, you've come to the correct place! Of course, the best way to learn is to find one of our certified Judges and ask for a game/tutorial :) If you can't find one, or if you want to learn NOW, then read on!
        </p>

        <h2 id="htp2">Where (and what) to Buy</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, you need a deck. Force of Will Starter Decks can be bought for a bit more than 700php on your friendly local game store. If they don't stock FoW, then you should ask them! :) Although you can probably find Force of Will Starter Decks and Booster Packs more readily at <a href="
            http://neutralgrounds.net/v2/branches/">Neutral Grounds</a>, FoW's official retailer here at the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>If you have found some, it's generally recommended to get TWO starter decks since each one contains only 10 Magic Stones (a deck can have up to 20). Besides that, the starters have everything you need to play the game: a paper playmat with helpful guidelines, a rulebook and most importantly: a ruler and a 50-card preconstructed deck. It's not very competative, but it's a good start. Right now, there are five to choose from, one from each attribute: Light, Fire, Water, Wind and Darkness.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Light</strong> attribute cards prefer Healing and Defensive cards, as well as [Flying] Resonators (<a href="http://fowtcg.com/english-card-list-light">Visual Card List</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Fire</strong> attribute cards has a lot of high attack/low defense cards, and Resonators that [Explode] (<a href="http://fowtcg.com/english-card-list-fire">Visual Card List</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong> attribute cards focuses on card draw, resonator bounce effects and Resonators that cannot be targetted by spells or abilities (<a href="http://fowtcg.com/english-card-list-water">Visual Card List</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Wind</strong> attribute cards are mostly defensive, with cards that cancel other spells. (<a href="http://fowtcg.com/english-card-list-wind">Visual Card List</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Darkness</strong> The Darkness Attribute cards focuses in high risk/high reward Spells and Resonators. (<a href="http://fowtcg.com/english-card-list-darkness">Visual Card List</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, the descriptions above are generalizations: Outright killing Resonators in the field sounds like a very Darkness trait, but both Light and Fire can have destroy effects too. Also, playing with a multi-attribute decks can shore up any weaknesses found on an attribute, at a relatively small cost of potentially muddying the magic stone deck (eg. drawing Wind Magic Stones when you have a lot of Water attribute cards in hand).</p>
        <p>After choosing (and purchasing) a starter deck, you can now play the game! Feel free to buy a booster pack or two so that you can start customizing your deck (<a href="{{BASE_PATH}}/deckbuilder">use our deckbuilder!</a>), as well as start building up your collection :)</p>

        <h2 id="htp3">How to Set the Game up</h2>
        <h4 id="htp31">Check your decks!</h4>
        <p>A Force of Will tournament legal deck contains 20 (or less) Magic Stones paired with 40 to 60 cards in the Main Deck, plus one Ruler Card. Also, each non-Magic Stone card can only have up to four copies maximum.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong> DO NOT reveal your Ruler until the last possible second! Don't give your opponents clues regarding how your deck works.
        </p>
        <h4 id="htp32">Who goes First?</h4>
        <p>Players should randomly determine who goes first. Remember, whoever goes first skips their draw phase!
        </p>
        <h4 id="htp33">Initial Hand &amp; Mulligan</h4>
        <p>Each player can now draw five cards from their Main Deck. Afterwards, the players can choose any number of cards from their hand, put those cards in the bottom of their Main Deck. They may now draw the same number of cards. This is called a Mulligan (a partial Mulligan, to be specific), and this can only be done once, and can also be skipped entirely.</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong> Each player should end up w/ 5 cards in hand, regardless if they mulliganed or not.
        </p>
        <h4 id="htp34">Prepare your Life Break</h4>
        <p>Draw the top four cards of your deck, and place it face down in a seperate Life Break pile. It has to be in a first-drawn, last-on-the-pile order. 
        </p>
        <h4 id="htp35">Reveal your Ruler!</h4>
        <p>When all players have their hand of five cards, and four face down cards in their life break area, then you can now simultaneously reveal your rulers. The rules say that everyone should <em>'exclaim "SET THE RULER!"'</em> when this is done, but that's not required ;)  
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong> All players start with 4000 life (essentially 40, since the last two zeroes are rarely, if ever, used) and when it hits zero, then that player is out of the game. The objective of the game is to become the last man standing. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="htp4">What to Do on Your Turn</h2>
        <h4 id="htp41">Draw a Card</h4>
        <p>Draw one card from the Main Deck.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong> If this is the very first turn of the game, SKIP THIS PHASE! :)
        </p>
        <h4 id="htp42">Recover your Cards</h4>
        <p>Recover (eg. straighten/untap) all of the cards in your field.
        </p>
        <h4 id="htp43">Call a Magic Stone</h4>
        <p>Decide whether you should call a magic stone or not. If you think you're not going to need to activate your Ruler Card this turn, then go ahead and use it to call a magic stone. If not, then you can skip this phase.</p>
        <p>If you decide to Call a Magic Stone, then Rest (bow/tap) your Ruler Card and put the top card of your Magic Stone Deck into the field.
        </p>  
        <p><strong>Note</strong> Remember that when you play a spell (summon a resonator, cast a chant, etc.) then it automatically means you skipped the Call Phase. 
        </p>
        <h4 id="htp44">Everything Else :)</h4>
        <p>Here's a list of things that you can do. Note that you can do any of these, any number of times (even none of these!).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>J-Activate your Ruler</strong> This is the only time you can J-Activate your ruler. If you can pay the J-Activate cost, and you have no qualms about betting half of your life (which you will lose IF your J-Ruler dies), then go ahead and <em>provoke the Judgement of your Ruler</em>, as the Game Rules say :)</li>
            <li><strong>Summon a Resonator</strong> If you have Magic Stones to generate enough Will to pay for a Resonator's Attribute Cost (The Attribute Icons on the upper left part of a Resonator card) AND its Free Cost (The Number just beside the Attribute Cost), then Rest the exact amount of Magic stones to pay the cost and put the Resonator in you field. Note that Resonators that was just summoned cannot Attack or Activate abilities with Rest as a Cost, but can Activate abilities that has costs other than Rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Cast a Spell Card</strong> There are three kinds of spell cards in Force of Will: A Spell: Chant, which can be used on your turn only. Another is a Spell: Chant - Instant, which is exactly like Spell: Chant, except you can use it as a Chase. And lastly, a Spell: Chant - Standby, which can be player exactly like a Spell: Chant, or you can pay 2 Will (of any Attribute) and play it face down on the Standby Area.</li>
            <li><strong>Cast an Addition Card</strong> An Addition Card usually has a subtype, like Addition: Resonator, or Addition: Field. After paying the cost to play the Addition, attach it to its target subtype.</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger a Spell on Standby</strong> If you have a card in your standby area, and you can fulfill the Standby Trigger, you can reveal the card and do its effects. Triggering a Spell on Standby has a different cost: you only need to have enough Magic Stones to pay the spell's cost BUT you don't actually rest those stones and pay it. Note that some Standby Triggers can also be activated as a Chase.</li>
            <li><strong>Activate an Ability</strong> If one of the card in your field has an [Activate] ability, then you can use it as long as you can pay the abilties' cost (if it has one). Note that most abilities can also be activated as a Chase.</li>
            <li><strong>Attack!!</strong> A recovered resonator (straight/untapped) that you control can attack either another opposing resonator, or another player. You must declare the attack and the target, then Rest (bow/tap) your attacker (All players have an opportunity to Chase here). The player being attacked may now choose to block with one of their recovered resonators (Again, all players have an opportunity to Chase here). If your attacking resonator is unblocked by another resonator, then it deals its ATK value to the opponent's Life. If an attacking resonator is blocked by (or just attacking) another resonator, then both resonators deal their ATK value to the other's DEF value. If any resonator's DEF reaches zero or lower, then that resonator is destroyed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="htp45">Pass the Turn</h4>
        <p>Remove all damage on all resonators, then tell the next player that your turn is done.
        </p>
        <h4h4 id="htp46">Special: Chasing an Action</h4>
        <p>After most of the actions discussed above, any player can "Chase" the action, with either a Lifebreak (discussed below), a Spell:Chant-Instant, a Standby Trigger or an Activatable Ability. The chasing action resolves first before the initial action, although any player can still "Chase" the chasing action. If multiple chases occur, then they resolve in a last-in/first-out order. 
        </p>
        <h4h id="htp47">Special: Lifebreak</h4>
        <p>Anytime during your turn, or as a Chase, you may use Lifebreak. Reveal a number of cards depending on your remaining life (1 if their Life is 31+, 2 if 21+, 3 if 11+ and 4 cards if 1+) in your lifebreak area, if there's any (as many as you are able to). If the revealed card has a [Break] ability, do it without paying the card's cost. Then put the revealed card in the graveyard (whether it has [Break] or not). This is useful when you no longer have any recovered Will or Cards that can Chase, and another player decides to attack you.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="htp5">Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimize your Main Deck!</strong> Since there can only be 4 copies of one card in your Main Deck, one way to increase the chance of drawing the cards that you need is to reduce the total number of cards to the absolute minimum allowed: 40 Cards. This will make sure that you won't draw any unnecessary cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximize your Magic Stone Deck!</strong> On the other hand, since there's no limit to the number of Magic Stones in your Magic Stone Deck, the total number of cards won't matter: only the ratio of attributes. If you have 20 Water Cards and 20 Darkness Cards, then having 10 Water Magic Stones and 10 Darkness Magic Stones will have the exact same percent of drawing as 5 and 5, or 2 and 2. They're both 50%; therfore, you can have up to the maximum number of Magic Stones allowed in the deck: 20 Cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Draw effects first, summon &amp; spells later.</strong> If you have spells or abilities that lets you draw cards, prioritize doing so first in order to maxize your options before commiting to an action</li>
            <li><strong>Life is just another resource: Hold on to your Lifebreak!</strong> The lower your life becomes, more cards are revealed during a Lifebreak action. I recommend waiting until the last possible second before firing off your lifebreak.</li>
        </ul>
