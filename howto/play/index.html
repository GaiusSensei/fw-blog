<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    So, you want to learn how to play Force of Will? Well, you've come to the correct place! Of course, the best way to learn is to find one of our certified Judges and ask for a game and tutorial :) If you can't find one, or you want to learn NOW, then read on!
</p>

<h2>Where (and what) to Buy</h2>
<p>
    First and foremost, you need a deck. Force of Will Starter Decks can be bought for a bit more than 600php on your friendly local game store. If they don't stock FoW, then you should ask them! :) However, you can probably find Force of Will Starter Decks and Booster Packs more readily at <a href="
http://neutralgrounds.net/v2/branches/">Neutral Grounds</a>, FoW's official retailer here at the Philippines.

    If you have found some, it's generally recommended to get a starter deck. It has everything you need to play the game: a paper playmat with helpful guidelines, a rulebook and most importantly: a preconstructed deck. It's not very competative, but it's a good start. Right now, there are five to choose from, one from each attribute: Light, Fire, Water, Wind and Darkness.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Light</strong> The Light Attribute cards focuses in Protection (+X/+X, -X/0 &amp; 0/+X) and Healing.</li>
    <li><strong>Fire</strong> The Fire Attribute cards focuses in High Atk Resonators, [Explode] and Offensive Buffs (+X/0).</li>
    <li><strong>Water</strong> The Water Attribute cards focuses in Defensive Resonators &amp; Card Manipulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Wind</strong> The Wind Attribute cards focuses in Defensive Resonators &amp; Spell Cancellations.</li>
    <li><strong>Darkness</strong> The Darkness Attribute cards focuses in high risk/high reward Spells and Resonators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the descriptions above are generalizations: Outright killing Resonators in the field sounds like a very Darkness trait, but both Light and Fire can have destroy effects too. Also, playing with a multi-attribute decks can shore up any weaknesses found on a single-attribute, at the cost of potentially muddying the magic stone deck- but don't worry about that yet.</p>
<p>After choosing (and purchasing) a starter deck, you can now play the game! Feel free to buy a booster pack or two so that you can start customizing your deck (<a href="http://gaiussensei.github.io/fw-gate">use our deckbuilder!</a>), as well as start building up your collection :)</p>
